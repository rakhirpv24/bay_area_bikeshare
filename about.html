<p>The Bay Area Bike Share is the region’s bike sharing system with 700 bikes and 70 stations across the region, with locations in San Francisco, Redwood City, Mountain View, Palo Alto, and San Jose. Intended to provide Bay Area residents and visitors with an additional transportation option for getting around the region, the Bay Area Bike Share is fun, easy, and affordable. </p>

<p>A bike sharing system consists of a fleet of specially designed, heavy-duty, very durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations located throughout a region. Bay Area bikes can be rented from and returned to any station in the system, creating an efficient network with many possible combinations of start and end points.</p>

<p>With hundreds of bikes at stations along the peninsula, the system is available for use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The station network provides twice as many docking points as bicycles, assuring that an available dock to return your bike is always nearby.</p>
